## Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?
Actually, creating a portfolio website is a challenge journey to me because as a freelance graphic designer I really need to build a portfolio website for a lifetime. Before starting this, I had researched popular graphic designers’ portfolios and get some ideas to plan my website. 
-1)	Clean and simple interface
-2)	Add Customer reviews
-3)	Choose Attractive unique color palette
-4)	Add Skill Percentage

After that I design the Lo-Fi Wireframe for user experience subject then designed the High-Fidelity Wireframes.

Creating the website according to the  Wireframes is the biggest struggling part for me because need to build up totally same design. And search the code for animation parts and some properties in the website.

I struggled for loading time of the web pages so optimize images(In my previous designs I have a banner poster it original file size was more than  5gb  i reduce that file size to lower than 100 mb). 

## What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

1. -	When building a portfolio website require to chose person’s best works, suitable colors palette because every color have a meaning and it matching with site logo and designs, typology etc. this will help to Impress the visitors and stand out from the competition.
